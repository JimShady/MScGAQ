In personal monitoring campaigns data often needs to be combined from multiple measurement devices into one consolidated dataset before it can be analysed. In today's practical we are going to combine some simulated data from:

* A sidepak (measures PM2.5)
* A GPS device (measures location)
* A digital diary (user records current activity)

Once we have combined them we will make a table summarising the results, a graphs to visualise it, and a short animated GIF showing the persons movement and exposure in each transport mode.

## Data import & linking

First we import the PM2.5 data from the sidepak.

```{r}

pm25_data   <- 

```
